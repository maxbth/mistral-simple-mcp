/**
 * Builds the Hono app serving MCP over Streamable HTTP.
 *
 * `createMcpHonoApp` installs Host and Origin validation itself, automatically for
 * localhost-class binds, so DNS rebinding protection is in place before any handler runs.
 * The bearer check is layered on top and deliberately does not cover `/health`, which
 * container runtimes probe unauthenticated.
 *
 * `allowedOrigins` is passed but `allowedHosts` is NOT: they validate different headers.
 * Origin is the browser's claim about who opened the page; Host is the address the client
 * dialled. Feeding one allowlist to both would reject every request whose Host is the
 * server's own hostname unless that hostname also happened to be a permitted page origin —
 * which is exactly the common deployment (reached at mcp.example.com, embedded in a page on
 * app.example.com).
 *
 * A bind of `0.0.0.0` or `::` gets no automatic Host check (there is no single "localhost
 * identity" to validate against), so callers who bind that broadly are warned on stderr and
 * expected to compensate with `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` — this is exactly the Docker default path,
 * where it matters most.
 *
 * `allowedOrigins` is passed UNCONDITIONALLY, including as an empty array — see
 * `effectiveAllowedOrigins` for what goes into it. An empty array is the documented "allow no
 * browser origin": `validateOriginHeader` rejects every request that carries an `Origin` header
 * while letting header-less non-browser clients through. Passing `undefined` instead would
 * switch Origin validation OFF entirely, which on a `0.0.0.0` bind leaves the server with no
 * DNS-rebinding protection at all.

   * that happens to send an `Origin` fails Origin validation on any bind. Both produced a 403
   * on a route whose entire body is `{"status":"ok"}`.
   *
   * Exempting it costs nothing, because those two checks defend against a threat this route
   * does not carry. DNS-rebinding protection exists so a malicious page cannot use a victim's
   * browser to read data from a server on their network; `/health` exposes no monitoring data,
   * no configuration, no credential, and mutates nothing. An attacker who reaches it learns
